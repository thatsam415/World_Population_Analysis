- **Average Density (per km²) by Continent**  
  Bar chart comparing population density among continents.

- **Sum of Growth Rate by Continent**  
  Bar chart depicting cumulative growth rates by continent.

- **Average Population by Continent Across Census Years**  
  Stacked bar chart showing average population across key census years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020).
